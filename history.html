                    <h4 class="color">1985-1992: FIRST YEARS</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/Radiohead-members-largo.jpg" class="border" alt="radiohead-band">
                    <p class="color-white">Radiohead started as schoolmates at Oxfordshire’s Abingdon School, jamming and rehearsing in the school’s rehearsal space. Even their first name, “On a Friday,” was derived from the band only being able to rehearse on Friday afternoons. 

                        In 1985, York, Greenwood, O’Brien, and Selway were the first to team up and would regularly switch instruments. The only trained musician in the band, Jonny Greenwood, Collins’ younger brother, joined the band last, originally as a Keyboard player.
                        
                        As Jonny says in an interview, he couldn’t play keys at the time and lowered the volume of the keyboard for no one to notice.
                        
                        In 1987 all the members besides Jonny went to university and would get together during holidays to rehearse. The band even got an offer from a small label before departing for Uni, but they decided it wasn’t time yet. The next four years would only see the band rehearsing and never play shows.
                        
                        After the band got together again in 1991, less than ten shows later; they got an offer to record a demo with Shoegaze producer Chris Hufford. EMI records liked what they heard, and the band recorded the EP “Drill” that featured the now legendary track, “Creep.” 
                        
                        As it was with most alternative bands, the UK did not accept them at first, and “Creep” didn’t receive airplay as some radio stations considered it “too depressing.” It wasn’t until their first album that the band would gain a following.</p>
                    <h4 class="color">1992-1994: "CREEP", PABLO HONEY</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/Radiohead-members.jpg" class="border" alt="radiohead-band">
                    <p class="color-white">The debut album from Radiohead, spearheaded by the single “Creep,” was a slow gainer that eventually became a gold record.

                        Everyone was skeptical about the album, and none from Capitol Records, including the producer, was convinced until they heard the band perform “Creep.”
                        
                        The song is now tied to the band’s legacy more than any other track. However, I think that’s mostly because, at the time, it was the only song that had strong songwriting and went along with the grunge wave of the time. 
                        
                        “Pablo Honey” is not Radiohead’s best work, as it lacks the refined touch of the other albums. Jonny Greenwood was not yet the arranger he is now, and overall the three weeks recording session might have been rushed for the inexperienced band.
                        
                        The other single, “Anyone Can Play Guitar,” is my favorite of the album — a guitar-heavy tune representing a style I’d later miss from Radiohead.
                        
                        The album and its hit single started to pick up in Israel and the US, where the band would heavily tour to successfully promote it. Eventually, “Creep” reached number 7 on the UK charts bringing the quintet to play big festivals. </p>
                    <h4 class="color">1994-1995: THE BENDS</h4>
                    <p class="color-white">The second Radiohead album is a tighter, better sounding and executed album. The songwriting, I feel, is much more refined, with multiple songs becoming minor hits. 

                        Radiohead had more time to record and was much tighter due to the heavy touring. The period though was anything but relaxed. The band was under pressure to release a hit record, and as York describes it, “We had days of painful self-analysis, a total fucking meltdown for two months.”
                        
                        I think there isn’t a single weak song in this album. It’s much more dynamic, leaving behind the guitar wall of sound for more intricate, sometimes sparse arrangements. This might be the first Britpop album to inspire future bands like Coldplay.
                        
                        My favorite tracks are “My Iron Lung” and “Fake Plastic Trees.” The acoustic intro on the second song is probably my favorite Yorke vocal performance in a Radiohead song.
                        
                        The album overall was better received and even nominated for the Best British Album.</p>
                    <h4 class="color">1995-1998: OK COMPUTER</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/ok-c-wallpaper.jpg" class="border" alt="radiohead-band">
                    <p class="color-white">The third Radiohead album is their masterpiece and is widely considered one of the best albums of all time. In some ways, I consider it to be a 90s alternative rock “Dark Side of The Moon.”

                        The album’s main themes are alienation, consumerism, politics, and how modern society presses down the human soul. The unconventional recording methods used for the album perfectly complement the lyrics in the visions of Radiohead and co-producer Nigel Godrich.
                        
                        Musically it’s different from the rock-infused previous albums. It features experimental electronic soundscapes more similar at times to a film soundtrack and new instruments they never featured before. York’s haunting vocals leave space for airy instrumentations and modern guitar work.
                        
                        Overall it’s one of the few “perfect albums” where each song is a small piece of a masterpiece. As with many revolutionary works, labels found it too abstract to market, yet it peaked at number 1 in the UK charts and would sell over 8 million copies.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="color">2000: KID A</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/kid-a-wallpaper.jpg" class="border" alt="radiohead-band">
                    <p class="color-white">Radiohead was by now the biggest alternative rock band in the world with a cult following. Even though the band was at its peak, the pressures of touring, recording, and further alienation brought them almost to breaking up.
                        Thom Yorke suffered from depression, and the whole band was on a creative block. Yorke was unsatisfied with the rock musical direction and got burned out from overplaying the Ok Computer songs. All of these led to an album that might be one of the greatest left turns in music history. 
                        KID A is an experimental record where Radiohead drifts from rock to incorporate more electronic, classical, and jazz elements. They scraped all the old songs and started learning electronic instruments. Rock guitars were replaced with synths, and even storytelling lyrics were replaced by random words put together with the only goal of setting a mood.
                        A listen to the title track is the best introduction to the new Radiohead Sound.
                    </p>
                    <p class="color-white">The title “KID A” refers to the first human clone and gives the feeling of emptiness, bareness, and distance from human emotion. Even without the intent of creating a meaningful album, they created another classic album that stretched beyond any genre.

                        The band was the first major act to release an album only online. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="color">2001: AMNESIA</h4>
                    <p class="color-white">The following album was taken from the leftover recordings of the KID A sessions. Whatever the band released by now would reach number 1, and so did this album. 
                        My favorite Radiohead song, a gloomy, angsty, and uneasy track called “Pyramid Song,” was one of the singles released from the record. I never heard anything similar to it; it’s rhythmically complex with a very odd chord progression. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="color">2003: HAIL TO THE THIEF</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/hail-wallpaper.jpg" class="border" alt="radiohead-band">
                    <p class="color-white">“Hail To The Thief” is the best Radiohead album to combine electronic sounds with acoustic instruments. The rock guitars return while ambient sounds are slightly more sparse. 

                        It’s both a tightly wound and an easily flowing album with much improvisation on it. If you are a rock fan, it might be the best album to start with “modern” Radiohead. The soul-touching piano and guitar parts are a sonic delight.
                        
                        The British rock, almost psychedelic track “There, There” is my favorite from the album. Fuzzy tense guitar riffs are the track’s theme, and it’s accompanied by one of the typical “weird” Radiohead music videos with York as the main protagonist. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="color">2007: IN RAINBOWS</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/inrainbows.jpg" class="border" alt="radiohead-band">
                    <p class="color-white">The next album in the Radiohead catalog was another creative leap for the band. The contract with their label was finished, and they had no more deadlines and obligations to make music. The final product would be their most ‘human’ album.

                        The album was probably the most difficult to record. The tour life had taken all their strength, and they stopped working for a few months and worked on solo albums to break the creative rut. With producer Neil Godrich back and after a short tour, they found confidence and started the recording sessions.
                        
                        The final album features ten tracks — a more concise album than the previous one. It’s dreamy, both with rock-infused tracks and soft ambient tracks. It feels more sensual and warm with some RnB elements put into the mix.  
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="color">2011: THE KING OF LIMBS</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/Radioheadthekingoflimbs.png" class="border" alt="radiohead-band">
                    <p class="color-white">The next album is another experimental-sounding record. By now, the fans were used to them trying out new elements with each new release. 

                        The basics of the album are loops and electronic sampling of their instruments. What started as a two-week experiment ended up on a six-month work for the album.
                        
                        I feel like this is not Radiohead’s best work in any way, and many consider it their worst. The funny thing about it is that there are no bad songs, just experimental ones that it’s hard to categorize. The album, compared to “In Rainbows,” apart from York’s vocals, feels cold and robotic.
                        
                        I don’t think there are any strong tunes in the album either, as no piece is particularly memorable. The album is more hypnotic than it is musical, as there are no surprises, and the songs can get repetitive for the non-electronic music listener. When played live, however, the songs sound much better. 
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="color">2016: A MOON SHAPED POOL</h4>
                    <img src="assets/img/amoon.jpg" class="border" alt="radiohead-band">
                    <p class="color-white">The last album so far from the band is now six years old, the longest gap between Radiohead albums. It’s a melancholic album, different from the gloomy mood of the previous ones; it feels in a way like a conclusion to this chapter of Radiohead.

                        It’s very different from every other Radiohead song and features many tracks written during the KID A session and even a 1995 song, “True Love Waits.” 
                        
                        I feel like this album is the marriage of the “Ok Computer” era with a classical orchestra. 
                        
                        The orchestration of the record is sublime, with choral voices, soft strings, and an overall cinematic feel. The album is filled with songs of love and regret and even directed to the deteriorating environment. York’s divorce from his wife of 20 years I thought to have brought most of the inspiration for the album.
                        
                        The band is currently in no rush to record together again. A “Moon Shaped Pool” is for sure the end of this 20-year chapter, and I believe they might get together once they have an idea for the next chapter ready.
